						<p>In addition to the engineering expertise, I learned a few really useful things about similarly-scoped projects that I'd like to pass on to anyone who might attempt a similar project in the future.
							<ul>
							<li>First, prototype early and often.  It is far better to admit that you haven't yet thought of a mechanism for one specific part of the system and get a revision out with other parts that are thought of than delay while you wait to have something that is 'theoretically' perfect.</li>
							<li>Second, be very afraid of the unknown.  We attempted to use a BeagleBone Black as our microcontroller, and it was a very bad decision.  It was finicky, barely worked, and needed 1-2 hours of reflash time every time it crashed.  Conventional wisdom is often that way because a lot of people have already made the same mistake you're about to.</li>
							<li>Finally, very little is more important than team dynamics and working well as a team -- except for having fun while you work, and the two often go hand in hand.  We were all willing to put in large amounts of time outside of class -- often on the weekends -- because our meetings usually had a component of fun in them.  This also helped us deal with adversity; no one ever got shirty with anyone else, even when we were all frustrated.  Working with your friends doesn't always work well, but when it does, it works <i>really</i> well.</li></ul></p>
