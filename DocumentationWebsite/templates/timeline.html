		<h3>Getting Ready for Demo Day</h3>
		<p>Things seemed to lighten up after our drastic switch from the Beagle Bone to the Arduino Mega. We finally got some code working and implimented into our system. And we've managed to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star with our instrument!</p>

		<h3>Makeover of the Bow</h3>
		<p>We've had quite some problem with our bow ever since our first four-string prototype assembly. The wood material did not work as well as we thought it would, because of the very uneven contact surfaces between the strings and the bow, and inconsistant friction with the strings. We then decided to glue some horsehair onto the wooden bow wheel to see if there's any improvement. However, sadly, the result was a hot mess. We had trouble getting the horsehair onto the wheel in a very orderly and well distributed way. Over time the horsehair also began to fall off at places where there were no glue. Therefore gluing horsehair onto a wooden wheel turned out to be not a very good solution.</p>

		<p>We then turned to an acrylic wheel, because we believed that the contact surface would be much smoother from the laser cutting machine. However, turns out that the acrylic wheel was also not a viable solution. We then wondered if attaching strips of horsehair to the surface of a rubber strip would help with the smoothness and distribution of the horsehair. The rubber also sticks better onto the surface of the acrylic wheel, as hair and plastic do not stick well to each other.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Finally we figured out the perfect plan to create this bow. We braided the horsehair and cut groves into the acrylic wheel to position the hair at opposite ends of the wheel. This way none of the hair has to be glued down, we have maximum contact between the bow and the strings, and we have good amount of friction between the horsehair and the strings.</p>

		<h3>Decision to Move to Arduino Mega</h3>
		<p>Today is a sad day for Team Looney Tunes. For around the 5th time, the Beagle Bone has crashed while we were trying to integrate it with the entire system. It works with each individual part, but freezes when asked to perform complex tasks. We've had to re-flash it several times in order to resolve it being frozen. As shown in the image below, sometimes the microprocessor will freeze with only two lights on. (Normal operation is with all lights blinking.) Overall, although the Beagle Bone's features are perfect for what we want to do, it is not reliable enough for our robotic violin. We have switched to the Arduino Mega. This microprocessor will not connect to the web as we wanted to, but will reliably work.</p>

		<h3>Final Prototype Assembly</h3>
		<p>Since Thanksgiving Break, we have been working on our final prototype. We fixed things we didn't like and things that were problematic from the previous prototype. These changes included obtaining nice flat wood, adding more support to decrease the bending of the bridge, designing a new encoder mounting, and adding secondary encoders.<p>

		<p>Once we've compiled all of our parts for our entire system, we began our assembly process. In the meantime, we also tested our motors with the Beagle Bone.</p>

		<h3>Critical Design Review - 11.19.13</h3>
		<p>The goal for this design review was to make sure we had all of our critical subsystems working, or at least we have an idea of how to solve the critical problems.</p>
		<p>Our critical subsystems included: transition from 1 string to 4 strings, addition of an amplifier, making sure the "string pulling" system works, and finally having all connections through the Beagle Bone. We were able to have all of our critical subsystems ready, except for the connection through the Beagle Bone. We believed that our bow wheel was not a critical subsystem.</p>

		<img class="picture" src = "{{ url_for('static', filename='images/amplifier_diagram.jpg')}}"/>
		<p>Most of the feedback we've received from our design review were concerns about our bow wheel. Turns out that our bow wheel was a critical subsystem that we needed to find a solution to fast.</p>
		<p>For our bow, we believe we can apply the same characteristics from the bow of a hurdy gurdy to our bow.</p>

		<h3>First Broken String</h3>
		<p> While working with our four-string prototype, one of the wires from the BeagleBone to the the A motor came loose. Thus, the motor though we were driving it with a HIGH and LOW signal. Our reflexes weren't fast enough to unplug the power and we ended up with our first broken string. We are sure this is just going to be one of many... </p>

		<h3>Initial Four-String Prototype</h3>
		<p>After the Preliminary Design Review, we immediately began CAD-ing our four-string prototype. Once everything was good to go, we began to assembly our very first four-string prototype.</p>

		<h3>Preliminary Design Review - 10.28.13</h3>
		<p>For this preliminary design review, we talked about our design goals, our three main mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems, and our schedule for this final project. Some of our goals include: we will create a string instrument that is controlled and played mechanically, the instrument will be capable of playing music that a traditional violin cannot play (e.g. chords and large interval gaps), and the system will connect to an engaging interface for listerners to choose songs from.</p>
		<p>Before throwing ourselves into working on the three separate subsystems, some major design decisions had to be made. We decided that we would control the pitch of the strings by means of changing the tension of the string, instead of having set pressers to press down on the strings to change the pitch. We also decided to use a BeagleBone as our microcontroller because of the vast amount of pins it has.</p>
		<p>From all these decisions and subsystems, we've decided that the most critical part of our system is being able to change the pitch of the string by means of changing the tension of the string. Hence for our Preliminary Design Review, we made sure to have a working tension system to showcase. Below attached is our PowerPoint of our presentation for the design review. Also, below are two video examples of our tensioning of the strings.</p>

		<h3>Initial Thoughts on Mechanical Design - 10.22.13</h3>
		<p>Below are some of our initial ideas and testing of the tensioning of the string of our mechanical subsystem. We've decided to go with a worm gear to prevent back driving of the motor.</p>
